# Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation example

## Tasks:

1. How does the JavaScript in myScript.js get access to the elements of the HTML page that it needs to manipulate or monitor?
1. change the code so that when a character is clicked on, its name is displayed in capitals, as well as its abilities reported.
1. Add another button to the html page and write javascript in myScript.js to make that button do something different when clicked (e.g. remove one character from the array, or pick one at random)
